		<h2>Duration</h2>
		<p>15 minutes</p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>
			The primary goal is to create a new Xamarin.Forms application using the provided project templates in Visual Studio.
			We will then walk through the project and explore all the parts.
		</p>

		<p>
			A secondary goal is to see how to share code between platform-specific projects
			(for more information, see <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/building_cross_platform_applications/sharing_code_options/">Sharing Code with Shared Projects and Portable Class Libraries</a>).

			<h2>Create the Xamarin.Forms project (Visual Studio on Windows)</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Open Visual Studio and create a New Solution.
				</li>
				<li>
					In Visual Studio 2017, select <b>Visual C# > Cross-Platform > Cross Platform App</b> which will then open a second dialog allowing you
					to create a <b>BlankApp</b> Xamarin.Forms solution with either a PCL or Shared Project.<br />
					For older Visual Studio installations where there are multiple Xamarin.Forms solution templates, in the New Project dialog,
					select <b>Visual C# > Cross-Platform</b>. You should see several project types in the right-hand pane, three of them are for
					Xamarin.Forms: <b>Blank App (Xamarin.Forms Portable)</b> for a Xamarin.Forms app backed by a shared Portable Class Library (PCL),
					<b>Blank App (Xamarin.Forms Shared)</b> for a Xamarin.Forms project backed by a Shared Project, and
					<b>Class Library (Xamarin.Forms Portable)</b> for a PCL you can use with existing Xamarin.Forms applications.
				</li>
				<li>
					We will want to go through both variations of the <b>Blank App</b> templates, and ultimately, they will generate the same basic code
					structure - the difference is only in the library packaging (PCL vs. Shared Project). Select the Shared Project to start with,
					go through the structure (below) and then do the same for the PCL variation.
				</li>
				<li>
					The lab instructions assume you have named the project "FirstApp", but you can use whatever name you prefer.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Walk through the solution structure</h2>
			<p>
				Next, let's go through the created project and identify all the pieces that make up the application.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					You will have multiple projects in the solution:
					<ul class="indent-none">
						<li>
							<b>FirstApp</b> - this is the shared project or PCL which has the platform-agnostic Xamarin.Forms code in it.
							This is where you will add the majority of your UI and logic.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>FirstApp.iOS</b> - this is the iOS platform-specific project which will create the iOS application.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>FirstApp.Droid</b> - this is the Android-specific project which will create the Android application.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>FirstApp.UWP</b> - this is the Universal Windows Platform project which will generate the app for deployment
							to the UWP device families.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ide name="vs">
						Explore the shared code first - depending on your Visual Studio version, it will either have your <code>Application</code>
						derived class declared in XAML with a C# backing file or just a single C# class used to identify your main screen.

						If you only have <b>App.cs</b>, open that source file and skip the remainder of this step.

						If you have the <b>App.xaml</b> file, expand the node in the Solution Explorer and open <b>App.xaml.cs</b>.
						We want to proceed with a code-based UI for simplicity. (We learn more about XAML in XAM130.)
						Since the template generated a UI using XAML, we will remove it.

						<ul class="indent-none">
							<li>Delete <b>MainPage.xaml</b> and <b>MainPage.xaml.cs</b> files.</li>
							<li>
								Inside <b>App.xaml.cs</b>, swap out the existing <code>public App()</code> constructor for this one containing a code-based UI:

<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
public App()
{
   // The root page of your application
   MainPage = new ContentPage {
      Content = new StackLayout {
         VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
         Children = {
            new Label {
               HorizontalTextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center,
               Text = "Welcome to Xamarin Forms!"
            }
         }
      }
   };
}
</pre>
							</li>
						</ul>

						Inside the <b>Application</b> source file, you will find that it creates a single <code>ContentPage</code> and assigns it to
						the <code>MainPage</code> property. This property identifies the first page shown in the application.
					</ide>
					<ide name="xs">
						Explore the shared code library first - it should have a single source file in it, this is the <code>Application</code>
						derived class which is used to identify your main screen. If you open the source file, you will find that it creates a
						single <code>ContentPage</code> and assigns it to the <code>MainPage</code> property. This property identifies the first
						page shown in the application, and if you change it while the application is running, the displayed screen will change in response.
					</ide>
				</li>
				<li>
					The platform-specific projects all have code unique to their platform, but there are some things in common as well.
					<ul class="indent-none">
						<li>
							All of them have references to at least two Xamarin.Forms assemblies. <b>Xamarin.Forms.Core</b> defines all the
							shared types across all platforms. This assembly is also referenced by any PCLs you use. Then you will see a
							<b>Xamarin.Forms.Platform.xxx</b> assembly which defines the unique platform-specific types for this platform.
							This reference will change based on iOS vs. Android vs. Windows. In addition, all of them have a reference to
							<b>Xamarin.Forms.Xaml</b> which defines all the XAML parser types - we aren't using this here, but we'll look at that in the next class.
						</li>
						<li>
							All projects have some standard initialization code. First, they all must call <code>Xamarin.Forms.Init</code>.
							This is a platform-specific method that is defined in all the platform assemblies (e.g. it is always the same name
							even though it's implemented differently per-platform). Each one takes slightly different parameters - Android passes
							in the application bundle for example so that Xamarin.Forms can locate resources.
							Next, there will be a call to <code>LoadApplication</code> which is passed a new instance of the <code>Application</code>
							derived class defined in the shared code. This is what creates the initial screen specific to the technology.
						</li>
						<li>
							These platform-specific projects are very minimal - they contain resources, manifests, and the boilerplate setup you
							always have in that project style.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Create the Xamarin.Forms project (Visual Studio for Mac)</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Open Visual Studio and create a new Project/Solution.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the New Project wizard, select <b>Multiplatform &gt; App &gt; Blank Forms App</b>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Shared Code option on the dialog decides how code will be shared for the app.<br />
					You can share the code using either a Portable Class Library (PCL) or Shared Library (sometimes called a "Shared Project").
					We will try both in the live class, starting with the Shared Library so select that first.
				</li>
				<li>
					Deselect the &quot;Use XAML for the user interface files&quot; checkbox so your project will match the details below.
				</li>
				<li>
					The lab instructions assume you have named the project "FirstApp", but you can use whatever name you prefer.
					Click <b>Next</b> to continue.
				</li>
				<li>
					Uncheck <b>Version Control</b> and <b>Xamarin Test Cloud</b> if either of them are checked.
					Click <b>Create</b> to create the projects.
				</li>

		<h2>Run the application</h2>
		<p>
			Let's run the application to see how it works.
		</p>

		<div class="hintblock">
			Depending on which device platform you are running on, the build type (Debug+iPhoneSimulator, Debug+ARM, Debug+AnyCPU, etc.) may
			restrict the places you can deploy to, and even the projects which are built. If you have trouble setting a project as active,
			or you get deployment errors, then check the build type <em>and</em> the solution configuration to see which projects are being built.
		</div>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Select an environment you have configured and make the platform-specific project associated with that environment the startup
				project in your IDE. You cannot start the shared code project - you can only run the platform projects.
			</li>

			<li>
				Run the application on a device or in a simulator/emulator. It will display a single piece of text that is centered on the screen.
				If you go back to the shared code and open the <code>Application</code> class, you will find that same text is the value for
				the <code>Label</code> being created there.
			</li>

			<li>
				Try running the application in a second environment. You should see the same text label - but the style of the application should
				be unique to the platform.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Optional - explore the architecture</h2>
		<p>
			Let's add a <code>Button</code> to the single page. We will then wire up an event handler to the <code>Clicked</code> event and use
			a breakpoint to stop the application to see how events are bubbled from the platform into the shared code.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Open the shared application class implementation and add a <code>Button</code> into the UI - here's an example to guide you,
				we are reorganizing it slightly:
			</li>
		</ol>
<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
public App()
{
    // The root page of your application
    var layout = new StackLayout
    {
        VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
        Children = {
            new Label {
                HorizontalTextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center,
                Text = "Welcome to Xamarin Forms!"
            }
        }
    };

    MainPage = new ContentPage {
        Content = layout
    };

    Button button = new Button {
        Text = "Click Me"
    };

    button.Clicked += async (s, e) => {
            await MainPage.DisplayAlert("Alert", "You clicked me", "OK");
        };

    layout.Children.Add(button);            
}    
</pre>

		<ol start="2">
			<li>
				Run the application again - you should now see a button in the UI, just under the label. Tap the button to generate a UI message.
			</li>

			<li>
				Set a breakpoint in the button <code>Clicked</code> handler and tap the button again. While the debugger is stopped, examine the call
				stack - notice that at the bottom you find native handlers - in Android, it will clearly come from java.widgets, in UWP, you will see
				a XAML button and in iOS you will see some native iOS code methods. This is bubbled up through a view <em>renderer</em> which is what
				translates the platform-agnostic <code>Button</code> type we created into a native, platform-specific button.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			In this exercise, we have created a new Xamarin.Forms application and gone through the project structure to get a sense of what's included
			and the basics of how it executes.
